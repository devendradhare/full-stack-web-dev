        Assignment-2: Fundamentals of Python


1.  Write a command to get the Python version you are using.
ans-> To get the Python version using the command prompt (CMD) in Windows, you can follow these steps:
    1. Open the command prompt by pressing the Windows key + R, type "cmd" in the Run dialog box, and hit Enter.
    2. In the command prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
    python --version
    This command will display the Python version installed on your system.
    Note: If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to specify the version explicitly 
    by using the specific Python executable in the command. For example, if you have Python 3 installed, 
    you can use the command `python3 --version` to get the Python 3 version.

    

2.  What is PVM?
ans-> PVM stands for Python Virtual Machine. It is the runtime engine of Python that executes Python bytecode. 
      The PVM is responsible for interpreting and executing the compiled bytecode generated from Python source code.

      

3.  How to create .pyc (Byte Code) file from python source file?
ans-> Python automatically creates .pyc (byte code) files when you import modules or execute Python scripts. 
    However, if you specifically want to create .pyc files without executing the code, 
    you can use the `py_compile` module. Run the following command in the command prompt or terminal:
    python -m py_compile your_file.py
    This will generate a .pyc file for the given Python source file.

    

4.  How to run a Python file from command prompt or terminal?
ans-> To run a Python file from the command prompt or terminal, use the following command:
    python your_file.py
    Make sure you have Python installed and added to your system's PATH variable. 
    Replace "your_file.py" with the actual filename and path if it's in a different directory.

    

5.  "Data Types in Python are not keywords" - True or False
ans-> False. Data types in Python, such as `int`, `str`, `float`, and `bool`, are keywords in Python. 
    Keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language and cannot be used as 
    variable names or identifiers.
